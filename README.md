## Hello there, I'm Neil! ðŸ‘‹ 

###### Who am I? 
I am a 17 y.o. full-stack developer from Chicago with over five years of programming experience. I plan to major in StatML + CS at Carnegie Mellon University as an upcoming freshman. I currently utilize Python, Java, and React (.js + Native) as my main programming languages. Some of my projects include [ProspectiveProgramming](https://prospectiveprogramming.org/), LFHSBats (an IDE interface designed for APCSA classes at my high school; WIP), and [FuturePearStudios](https://futurepearstudios.co/). 

###### What am I currently doing?
I am currently dual-enrolled in [IIT _CS 331: Data Structures and Algorithms_](https://moss.cs.iit.edu/cs331/) to solidify my comprehension of data structures and to apply them in a Python environment (to add on, I have previous experience in using data structures in a Java-based environment). I'm also learning more advanced SQL concepts in my free time.
