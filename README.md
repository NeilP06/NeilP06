# Hello there, I'm Neil! 👋 

## Overview
I am a 19-year-old full-stack developer from Chicago with over seven years of programming experience. As a sophomore, I am majoring in Statistics & Machine Learning and Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University. I am deeply interested in computer vision, data engineering, and applied ML (especially in healthcare). Through my programming journey, I built products ranging from a fully interactive programming education platform to ML systems that evaluate company logistics and execute complex workflows. I love to build, starting from the idea to the finishing touches.

## Tech Stack
For front-end applications, I utilize React.js, Flask, and a little AI (shoutout Lovable). For back-end applications, I utilize Python with Tensorflow/PyTorch (either or), FastAPI, usually paired with other statistical tools. For data systems, I utilize PostgreSQL either with AWS or light databases (such as Supabase, Google Cloud, or MongoDB). In theory, I know C/C++, OCaml, Java, SQL, R, and SML; however, I seldom use these languages in applications. Lastly, I am a big Unix user, where I run all my applications on an M4 Max MacBook Pro.

## What I'm Currently Doing
Currently, I'm back for my third semester at CMU while hunting for internships. I also spend my time building some projects affiliated with the CMU Data Science Club, including [PokerAI](https://poker.cmudsc.com/) and SMS Optimization. I hope to get these projects out to the public soon!
