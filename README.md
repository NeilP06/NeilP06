## Hello there, I am NeilP06! ðŸ‘‹ 
_Welcome to my GitHub page and thank you for visiting!_

###### Q: Who are you? 
I am a 17-year-old full-stack developer from Chicago, having over five years of programming experience. During this time, I experimented with many programming languages, but I specifically got interested in Java & Python! I am also proficient in the MERN (MongoDB-Express-React-Node) stack.

###### Q: What are you working on currently?
Currently, I am interning in the Data Analytics field for a pharmaceutical company, but I also work on building games for my game-development studio (FuturePearStudios) and building prototypes for my non-profit (ProspectiveProgramming). I  also participate in hackathons here and there.

###### Q: What are you planningÂ to do next?
I plan to pursue research in the educational field this summer as I find the collaboration of data analytics & educational testing interesting. I am also registered for some significant programming competitions, so updates coming soon!
