## Hello there, I am NeilP06 
_Welcome to my Github page and thank you for visiting!_

###### Who am I? 
I am a 16-year-old programmer from Chicago, Illnois, who primarily programs in Java and Python, and sometimes creates some interesting from these two languages! 

###### What am I working on currently?
Well, I'm currently focused on learning more about data structures as I want to obtain a decent amount on knowledge for the most important ones, and if it isn't me learning more about data structures, I'd otherwise be practicing for the USACO or just writing sports-data articles on my sports website, https://thesidelinestat.com!
