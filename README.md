## Hello there, I am NeilP06! ðŸ‘‹ 
_Welcome to my GitHub page and thank you for visiting!_

###### Q: Who are you? 
I am a 17-year-old full-stack developer from Chicago, having over five years of programming experience. During this time, I experimented with many programming languages, but I specifically got interested in Java, Python, and Javascript!

###### Q: What are you working on currently?
Currently, I am interning in the Data Analytics field for a pharmaceutical company, but I also work on building games for my game-development studio, FuturePearStudios, among others. I  also participate in hackathons here and there.

###### Q: What are you planningÂ to do next?
I plan to pursue research in the educational field this summer as I find the collaboration of data analytics & educational testing interesting. I also registered in some significant programming competitions, hoping to at least win something.
