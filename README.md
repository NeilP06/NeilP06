# Hello there, I'm Neil! ðŸ‘‹ 

### Who am I? 
I am a 19-year-old full-stack developer from Chicago with over seven years of programming experience. As an upcoming sophomore, I double major in Statistics & Machine Learning and Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University. I am deeply interested in quantitative trading, data engineering, and computer vision applications. Some of my projects include [ProspectiveProgramming](https://prospectiveprogramming.org/) and [FuturePearStudios](https://realmz.io/). 

### What do I use?
I know C, OCaml, Java, Python, JavaScript (including the React.js & Next.js frameworks), SQL, and SML; however, I utilize React.js for the front end and Python + Flask for the backend. I use the Unix environment for the command line and Visual Studio Code as my IDE. 

### What am I currently doing?
Primarily, I will work at AbbVie as an Artificial Intelligence intern while taking summer classes (36-225 and 21-241) at CMU. On the side, I'll develop some projects affiliated with the CMU Data Science Club, including [PokerAI](https://cmudsc.com/archive/pokerai-2025), among other events. I also hope to revamp my portfolio site to add blogging functionality.
