# Hello there, I'm Neil! ðŸ‘‹ 

### Who am I? 
I am a 18 y.o. full-stack developer from Chicago with over six years of programming experience. As an upcoming freshman, I plan to major in Statistics & Machine Learning and Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University. I am deeply interested in the quantitative trading space of finance, data engineering, and computer vision applications. Some of my projects include [ProspectiveProgramming](https://prospectiveprogramming.org/) and [FuturePearStudios](https://realmz.io/). 

### What do I use?
I know Java, Python, Javascript, SQL, React (.js & Native), Next.js, and HTML/CSS; however, I utilize React.js for the front-end and Python + Flask for the back-end. I utilize the Unix environment for the command line, and I use Visual Studio Code as my IDE. I also use a 2019 i5 Macbook Pro 13" as my computer.

### What am I currently doing?
I am taking intro-level Machine Learning classes on Coursera this summer to improve my depth in the ML/AI space before entering college.
