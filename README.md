## Hello there, I am NeilP06! ðŸ‘‹ 
_Welcome to my Github page and thank you for visiting!_

###### Q: Who are you? 
I am a 16-year-old programmer from Chicago, Illinois, who primarily programs in Java and Python, and sometimes creates some interesting from these two languages! 

###### Q: What are you working on currently?
Well, I'm currently focused on learning more about data structures as I want to obtain a decent amount on knowledge for the more important data structures, and if I'm not doing this, I'd otherwise be practicing for the USACO, participating in hackathons, or just writing sports-data articles on my sports website, https://thesidelinestat.com!

###### Q: What are your programming achievements?
My biggest achievement in my programming career is possibly my Polynomial.java API with iterators, as it made me realize that I can program many different things with the knowledge I have currently. Otherwise, some of my other achievements are NFL06 (https://neilp06.net/nfl06), literally coding my portfolio (https://neilp06.net), a 5 on the AP Computer Science A exam (which I took last year), or having decent knowledge in other programming languages (specifically, Python & HTML/CSS).
